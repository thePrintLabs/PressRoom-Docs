- ###Flatplan
When you edit a post, page or allowed custom post type, you are able to select one or more *Edition* for the content item to be part of. You could even create new *Editions* from the same meta box. Items belonging to an *Edition* are listed under the *Edition* **flatplan**.
Items in the **flatplan** can be visible or hidden. Hidden items will not be included in the final package. Items can also be dragged to change their final order.

- ###Themes
PressRoom comes pre-bundled with an initial theme to let you start quickly. You could use it it as starting point to learn how PressRoom themes works or to start developing and adding your own. Themes added to the ```/pressroom/themes/``` folder will show up automatically.
For each *Edition* you are able to define a custom theme. Under each theme you are able to define an unlimited number of template files. Next to each content item in the **flatplan** you could select which template file to use for that particular item.

- ###Preview
Inside the *Edition* edit page and *Editions* list view, you are able perform a complete web preview of the overall edition.

- ###Publish
Each Edition must be part of an Editorial Project in order to be published. When an *Edition* is ready you'll use the **distribute** button to package all the content items, media and template assets and create a complete ```.hpub``` file. At the same time the related ```shelf.json``` gets updated on the parent *Editorial Project* endpoint.
