# Configuring an Editorial Project

Editorial Projects are containers for an unlimited number of Editions (Issues). Beyond its __name__ and __slug__ each Editorial Project allow you to define project wide Add-on settings. 

For example when the iOS Exporter addon is active each Editorial Project exposes a unique endpoint for iOS apps based on the Baker framework. Basically this means that a single PressRoom powered WordPress install could manage an unlimited number of *Editorial Projects*, and thus an unlimited number of Baker based Apps.
