# Connecting to Baker Framework Apps

*[screenshot placeholder]*

After you've created your first **Editorial Project** an endpoint for your Baker client will be generated.
You could find it under the ```shelf.json``` column in the Editorial Projects list view. Add your endpoint to the ```settings.plist``` file in your Baker client Xcode project and you're done. Pretty straightforward, isn't it ?

If you wish some background info about the ```settings.plist```you could look at [https://github.com/bakerframework/baker/issues/354](https://github.com/bakerframework/baker/issues/354)
