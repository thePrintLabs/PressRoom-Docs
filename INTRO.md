## Introducing PressRoom

PressRoom turns WordPress into a multiple channel publishing platform. It is being developed around a vision for digital publishing that we see growing and struggling with the available technologies.

Everything in PressRoom is structured around the concept of [Editorial Projects](configuring_an_editorial_project/README.md); they are containers for an unlimited number of [Issues](configuring_an_issue/README.md), which, in turn, are containers for any kind of content that you can already add and manage in WordPress.

An **Issue** can be exported at the same time to unlimited [iOS](pressroom_addons/ios_exporter/README.md) Apps based on the [Baker Framework ](https://github.com/bakerframework/baker) and to the [Web](pressroom_addons/web_exporter/README.md) as standalone microsites.

**PressRoom** is the perfect tool to embrace a [sub-compact publishing model](http://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing/), but youâ€™re not restricted to any kind of content structure, since everything is being built to be flexible and highly customizable. Suitable for books, magazines, newspapers or just to manage your static websites and release your blog to multiple channels.
