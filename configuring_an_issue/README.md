# Configuring an Issue


Create a new *Issue* under the 'Issues' admin menu item, then you'll proceed customizing the basic settings.

- ###Flatplan
When you edit a post, page or allowed custom post type, you are able to select one or more *Issue* for the content item to be part of. You could even create new *Issues* from the same meta box. Items belonging to an *Issue* are listed in the *Issue* **flatplan**.
Items in the **flatplan** can be visible or hidden. Hidden items will not be included in the final package. Items can also be dragged to change their final order.

- ###Themes
For each *Issue* you are able to define a custom theme. Under each theme you are able to define an unlimited number of template files. Next to each content item in the **flatplan** you could select which template file to use for that particular item.

- ###Preview
Inside the *Issue* edit page and *Issues* list view, you are able perform a complete web preview of the overall edition.

- ###Publish
Each Issue must be part of an Editorial Project in order to be published. When an *Issue* is ready you'll use the **distribute** button to package all the content items, media and template assets accordingly to the selected exporter. 

> For example in conjunction with the iOS Exporter it'll create a complete ```.hpub``` file. At the same time the related ```shelf.json``` gets updated on the parent *Editorial Project* endpoint. Free and paid Newsstand subscriptions can be created on iTunes Connect to support Newsstand Apps with free/paid content and automatic updates.
