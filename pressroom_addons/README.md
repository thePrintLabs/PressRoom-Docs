PressRoom add-ons are plugins meant to extend the PressRoom functionality. Actually we got two main add-ons:
- [Web Exporter](/web_exporter/README.md) extends the default web export feature with a set of custom container/navigator and the ability to develop your own.  
- [iOS Exporter](/ios_exporter/README.md), adds the ability to export Issue to feed a custom iOS App based on the Baker framework.
