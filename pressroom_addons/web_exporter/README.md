The Web Exporter Add-on adds the ability to generate a Web Container to let users browser an Editorial Project, its Issues and Contents of each Issue. It comes with multiple theme, different ajax behaviours (swipe, infinite scroll), offline caching and reading tools. It also allows you to develop you custom Web Containers.
