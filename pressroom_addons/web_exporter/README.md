# PressRoom Web Exporter

PressRoom by default allows you to freely export each edition as static html files and assets. The export could be published via ftp, sftp or local filesystem. Also each export optionally generates a zip package containing all the needed files.

The Web Exporter Add-on adds the ability to generate a Web Container to let users browse an Editorial Project, its Issues and the Content of each Issue. It comes with multiple themes, different ajax behaviours (swipe, infinite scroll), offline caching and reading tools. It also allows you to develop your custom Web Containers.
